### Overview
Are you into exercise or outdoor activities but would much rather not go solo on that physical adventure? You may want to check out ExerciseMeetup which will be available in major cities! ExerciseMeetup is a new app that enables a user to jumpstart into exercise when moving into a new city and meet new people with similar interests! Research has shown individuals are more likely to adhere to exercise if they feel a sense of community amongst other people for e.g. Curves and Crossfit. So why not sign up for a user account and start planning out your adventures on our calendar? You can schedule an activity indicating your skill level, date, time, and location of this excursion. Maybe you are just starting to mountain bike and would rather find someone similar in skill rather than trying to keep up with a mountain biking superstar soaring five miles ahead of you and hopping over the landscapes effortlessly. ExerciseMeetup allows you to glance over other users’ profiles to find a match that feels just right for you.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to enable users to upload pictures to their profile. I will also have to learn how to incorporate location services to track and display the distance between user inputs of addresses. Lastly, I will have to integrate various API’s into the web app such as GoogleMaps and haveibeenpwned.com.
